#> Biparpatile Graph -->A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V such that 
                        every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
                        The two sets U and V may be thought of as a coloring of the graph with two colors i.e.
                        if one colors all nodes in U blue, and all nodes in V green, each edge has endpoints of differing colors, 
                        as is required in the graph coloring problem.
                        In contrast, such a coloring is impossible in the case of a non-bipartite graph, such as a triangle.

    .)Application --> Railway Optimization Problem -->  Input is a schedule of trains and their stops, and the goal is to 
                      find a set of train stations as small as possible such that every train visits at least one of the chosen stations.
                      
                      Activity Selection Problem --> You are given n activities with their start and finish times. 
                      Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person 
                      can only work on a single activity at a time.
                      
                      A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.
